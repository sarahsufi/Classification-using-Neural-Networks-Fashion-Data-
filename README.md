Image Classification with Neural Networks

Overview

This project focuses on image classification using neural networks in Python. We use the MNIST Fashion dataset, which contains 70,000 images of clothing items, to train a neural network to classify these images into different fashion categories.

What is Classification?
Classification involves categorizing data into predefined classes based on their features. For image data, neural networks are particularly effective due to their ability to learn and recognize complex patterns in images.

Approach
Dataset: The MNIST Fashion dataset includes grayscale images of clothing, each labeled with one of ten fashion categories.
Data Preprocessing:
Normalization: Scale pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
Reshaping: Format data to fit the neural network’s input requirements.
Model Architecture:
Neural Network: Build a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras, featuring convolutional layers for extracting image features and dense layers for classification.
Training:
Loss Function: Use cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
Optimizer: Apply Adam or similar optimizer to improve model performance.
Evaluation:
Accuracy: Assess the model’s performance on the test set to gauge classification accuracy.
Libraries Used
TensorFlow, Keras: For building and training the neural network.
Numpy, Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib: For visualizing training results.
Usage

Train the Model: Execute python train_model.py to train the neural network on the MNIST Fashion dataset.
Evaluate the Model: Run python evaluate_model.py to evaluate the trained model’s accuracy.
